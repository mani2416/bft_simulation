# Contains the software that was implemented for the paper "Bernoulli meets PBFT"

- The PBFT simulation to evaluate BFT protocols in the presence of dynamic link failures
- The adapted BFT-SMaRt library to incorporate dynamic link failures
- The rust framework that initializes some nodes and triggers a single request to BFT-SMaRt in a loop

## Configuration
The PBFT simulation is configured with the 'simulation.ini' file
